/**
 A UIKit UIViewController that runs with a `Controller`.

 Make your view controllers inherit from this class as to take care of all the drudgery of setting up the controller and
 initializer song and dance.

 The view controller will make sure to set itself up properly with the given controller, including initializing UI,
 state and subscriptions in the right order as to avoid initialization glitches.

 The macOS version uses `representedObject` as the storage for the controller. Do _not_ modify the value of the
 property after initialization.

     This initializer is also for everyone else who builds the UI on code as it will default the parameters to nil
     after which you can override `loadView` and/or `viewDidLoad` to do the work.

     This method is the funnel for getting the UI up to date with the controller's model value. If the implementation
     gets too unwieldy you should probably think of decomposing your view controller into subcomponents.

     Don't call `super`, this is a pure abstract method. Even if your view controller is purely static you should
     provide an implementation override to run during UI initialization (see ``UIComponent.viewDidLoad``)

     `modelProperty.value` should already contain `newValue` per the API contract of `ReadOnlyProperty`. Either way you
     shouldn't depend on access to either of those for the implementation of this method.
